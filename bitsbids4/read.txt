app config like prot database connectiion is done in resources/application properties

Repository: Interface for data access, typically extends JpaRepository or CrudRepository for CRUD operations on the database.
Model: Java class representing the entity or data structure, annotated with @Entity.
Controller: Handles HTTP requests, uses @RestController annotation and defines request mappings with @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.

Controller: Like routes, it links endpoints (URLs) with functions. It handles HTTP requests and responses.
Repository: Defines the functions to interact with the database (like findAll, save, delete). It simplifies database queries (like SELECT statements).

Controller receives a request.
Controller calls a Service method.
Service uses a Repository to access the database.
Repository performs database operations and returns data.
Service processes the data and returns it to the Controller.
Controller sends the response back to the client

so service is like a function, controller is like router, and repository is like the sql query
ChatGPT
Yes, exactly:

Service: Like a function, it contains business logic and processes data.
Controller: Like a router, it handles HTTP requests and directs them to the appropriate service.
Repository: Like an SQL query, it interacts with the database to fetch or save data.


@Autowired is used to automatically inject dependencies into your classes
Dependencies: Objects or services your class needs to work, like a database handler, another service, or a configuration.
Example in Node.js context:

Dependency Injection: Similar to how you might use require to include modules in Node.js. For example, if you have a module for database operations, you inject it into your classes or functions that need it.
In Spring, @Autowired does this automatically. You define what classes or services you need, and Spring provides them for you.

When you run a Spring Boot application:

Application Startup: Spring Boot initializes the application context, which involves setting up the environment and configurations.

Component Scanning: Spring scans for components (e.g., @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller) in the specified packages.

Bean Creation: Spring creates instances of beans (such as services and repositories) and manages their lifecycle.

Dependency Injection: Spring automatically injects dependencies into beans using @Autowired. For instance, it provides an instance of BidRepository to MyService.

Application Ready: The application starts listening for requests (if it’s a web application) or performs other startup tasks as defined.    
 The @SpringBootApplication annotation includes @ComponentScan, which defaults to scanning the package where the main application class is located and its sub-packages.
